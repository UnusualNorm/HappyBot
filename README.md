# HappyBot
This very helpful Discord bot helps you stay positive in all of your very lovely Discord servers! All in one very nice line of code!

## But watch out!
This program only runs on the lovely Windows operating system, Although we do appreciate the geniouses using MacOS and Linux!
We find it easier to use the positively proprietary Windows operating system for this great project!

In all seriousness though, this project is meant as a joke, and not to be added to "real" Discord servers, it will (probably) make your server unusable.
This project was made as a one-off joke and challenge for myself, be warned, you will not recieve support for this program.

## What this revolutionary product does!
This new Discord bot brings all the happy times to your server! By utilising state-of-the-art A.I. we detect the sediment of all of your messages (images not included) to make sure they stay positive. If a message is found to not be positive enough, we gladly dispose of it, keeping the happy times in tact! Just like a country everyone inexplicably hates for some reason... Might be the government? üîç

## Installation is as easy as copy-pasting!
### Prerequisites:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [A Discord Bot Token](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

With your lovely bloated install of windows ready, just copy and paste these commands in your nice and complex terminal!
```
git clone https://github.com/UnusualNorm/HappyBot.git
cd HappyBot
npx yarn install
node . YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
```
And presto! You have yourself a nice and positive Discord server!
